#catalogue

-> defination Catalogue?
	list of items that are available for sale 
		&
	in simple terms catalogue is nothing but menu and that menu contains items.
		&
	catalogue is a microservice it contain items for sale.

-> all the system services are store in (those are directories)
	ls /etc/systemd/system

	eg: ls/etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service

-> we can create systemd service by
	vim /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service

-> server to server connection is possible only with private ip-address not with public ip-address

-> start reading the log files
	eg: systemctl restart catalogue ; tail /var/log/messages
	important to  read the logs and logs are best-friend to us in the system.

-> to read logs continuosly by
	eg: systemctl restart catalogue ; tail -f /var/log/messages

-> for application to connect database
	we need
	1. what is DB server IP		  (these are login-credentials of database
	2. what is username & password	  ( engineer role)

	1. which database		  (developer role)
	2. which table			  (these are schema od database)

-> apps are considered as two types:
	1. stateless apps
	2. stateful apps
	
	- databases are comes under statefull apps
	- functional apps what we make are comes under stateless apps

	= more connections that is made to a database is a problem in order to overcome that we use cache system which is known as 'redis'
