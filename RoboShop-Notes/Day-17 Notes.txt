# shell supports two quotes
# ' - single quote
# " - double quote

=> when to use quotes
=> if our input to any command is having a special characters ( not a-z, not 0-9, not _ ), then to nullify those special characters we use quotes.

-> echo *
-> echo "*" (or) echo '*'

-> single quotes are literal quoting ( strict quoting)
-> double quotes are liberal quoting ( less strict quoting)

echo 'a is $a'
echo "a is $a"

imp: Here '$' is considered as a special character.
Note: suggestion is that use double quotes.
